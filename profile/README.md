# Subset UCSD

**Here were some ideas that got us started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - our organization is all about turtles.
🌈 Contribution guidelines - the community can get involved by sharing their turtle photos.
👩‍💻 Useful resources - the community find our docs in the basement. There is nothing else the community should know.
🍿 Fun facts - our team eats turtles for breakfast.
🧙 We remember we can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
